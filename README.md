Scripts for use with Mystic BBS

Status, as of November 19th, 2019:
aprilpy.mpy - Contains earlier/different version of lightning, an earlier version of gogame, a "count to n" function, and a function that goes through various Mystic BBS commands, one after another. It's all very experimental, though the different version of lightning is interesting

gogame.mpy - It... mostly works. It's possible to play a game, challenge a person, go back and forth on moves, replay some example games... And if things go outside of a certain path, it'll go haywire very quickly. The code is a mess, and needs a rewrite where I think it through from the beginning, in order to separate out as much as possible (and make things able to be unit tested). I'll still consider it a success, though, as it was useful in teaching me some Python basics as well as some basics about what Mystic BBS can do.

lightning.mpy - Does a short flash of lightning using yellow and black. Simple program, works pretty well, seen on Storm BBS as an interstitial in a couple of spots.
