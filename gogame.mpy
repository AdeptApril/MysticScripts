## The intent is to eventually only have functions made by April,
## but this is meant as a quick-start sort of thing in order to
## start seeing how the BBS handles various Python code.

# Attempting to make a correspondance Go (Weiqi, Baduk) program
# First step: Display Go board of a certain size - Done
# Second step: Display black pieces on board when given coordinates - Done
# Step: switch color after each move - done
# Step: Keep track of current board position
# Step: See if piece already placed at requested location
# Step: See if piece placed on empty square is a legal move 
# Step: Deal with Ko
# Step: keep track of moves in game - perhaps use SGF format
# Known issues:
# Text output not cleared before writing new info (e.g., "Position not on board. Please try another" displayed, then
# "Move position: black at 03 03" displayed, but it becomes "Move position: black at 03 03 try another"
